# Attention-Models

## Description

This repository contains materials related to implementations of the attention mechanism as used in  Transformers
- **Self-attention:** Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that allows a model to attend to different positions within its own input sequence. It captures dependencies between different elements of the input sequence, enabling the model to weigh the importance of each element based on its relevance to other elements within the same sequence.

- **Cross-attention:** Cross-attention, also known as inter-attention, is an attention mechanism that allows a model to attend to different elements of multiple input sequences. It enables the model to capture dependencies and relationships between elements from different sequences, such as source and target sequences in machine translation. By attending to relevant information from both sequences, the model can generate accurate and contextually-aware predictions.

- **Multi-head attention:** Multi-head attention is an extension of the attention mechanism that enhances the expressive power and flexibility of the model. It allows the model to perform multiple attention operations in parallel, each focusing on a different representation or aspect of the input. By combining the results of these multiple attention heads, the model can capture different types of information and learn more nuanced relationships within the data, leading to improved performance and generalization.


## Installation
